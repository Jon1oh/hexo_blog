Hello there! 

My names is Jon. I'm an InfoSec Undergraduate at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) who gradauted from Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) with a Diploma in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics. I'm passionate about Information Security, Pentesting and all things in tech.

This site is my space to share my VulnLab write-ups, security research and projects. 

Besides cybersecurity, I'm a passionate fingerstyle guitarist, freelance chorister and fitness enthusiast.

Feel free to browse around. I hope you find something that interests you!

Best regards,
Jon Loh
